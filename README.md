# Ride Sharing Application.

## Prerequisites
- Docker

## Application Setup Process

STEP 1: run `docker compose up` on the project root folder to start up MongoDB, Redis and Kafka and allow the process to complete to call up the necessary services.
STEP 2: Find the README.md file in ridesharing-be for setup steps and running the backend application.
STEP 3: Find the README.md files in ridesharing-fe for setup steps and running the front end application

### NOTE:
Follow the installation tips accordingly for proper setup.

For stable testing between Riders and Drivers, you can use Google Chrome browser or Safari, 
although chrome uses ISP location and not real location.
You can have about three incognito modes in chrome to test between a rider and maybe 2 drivers as the case may be.
